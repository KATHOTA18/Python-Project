# COVID-19 Impact Analysis on Countries in 2020

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and determine the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year 2020. By leveraging data visualization techniques, this study provides insights into the global impact of the pandemic, highlighting the countries that faced the most significant challenges in terms of infection rates, mortality, and other relevant metrics.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Identify the countries most affected by COVID-19 in 2020.
- Visualize the spread and impact of the virus through data visualization techniques.
- Offer insights into the effectiveness of various response measures implemented across different countries.

## Data Sources

Data for this project was sourced from publicly available datasets, including:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mbicha/data_science/main/data/trainweek3_2.csv'

These datasets include daily updates on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's progression.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Collection:** Downloading the latest COVID-19 data from reputable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Preprocessing the data to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Analysis:** Using statistical methods to identify the most affected countries based on various metrics such as total cases, deaths, and case fatality rates.
4. **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of the data to illustrate the impact of COVID-19 across different countries. Tools used include Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

## Results

The analysis revealed that countries China, followed by both US and United Kingdom were the most affected by COVID-19 in 2020. Visualizations showcasing the progression of the pandemic and its impact on these countries are included in the [Results](/results) section.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python:** For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas and Numpy:** For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process.
